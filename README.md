### 2. Expand Database Fields - Demo/Solo
**Goal:** Retrieve more User fields from the database
- Study the database schema in MongoCompass
- Update mongoose model with missing fields that are present in the database
- Update GraphQL schema and FE query
- Display the new fields in the profile page
- **Bonus**: Add even more fields to the database that weren't present before and retrieve those as well
- **Files:** `user.model.js`, `user.graphql`, `user.fragment.js`

### 3. Update Form Dialog - Demo
**Goal:** Update functionality
- Form submission

- **Files:** `frontend/src/modules/overview/components/game_event_card.jsx`

### 3. Create Card Form Mutation - **Demo/Solo**
**Goal:** Implement functionality to create new Game Events
- Create a Dialog with a form with inputs for Game Event creation
- GraphQL mutation resolver/schema

### 4. Delete Card with Confirmation - **Solo**

- Create a GraphQL mutation for the DELETE operation
- UI feedback (loading states, success/error messages)
- Cache update after successful delete
- **Bonus:** Undo functionality
- **Files:** `backend/src/modules/game_event/graphql/game_event.graphql`, `frontend/src/modules/overview/forms/game_event_delete.form.jsx`
